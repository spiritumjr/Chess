# Description
This program is a 2player chess game.

## Installation
To be able to run this program, you'll need Tkinter and Pillow. Of course, Python is also needed.

### Library installation:
On Windows, open the command prompt and run these commands:
```bash
pip install tk
pip install Pillow
```
Once the libraries are installed, you just have to clone the project and run the main.py file in a Python 3.10 interpreter. (e.g. Visual Studio Code or PyCharm)

## Usage
To move the pieces, just click on a piece to highlight all of its possible moves. Then, just click on one of the highlighted squares to move the piece. Please note that the piece can only move at their turn. 

## Disclaimer
This project is in by no mean final and contains its fair share of bugs.
